title: Predicting Response to a Bank Telemarketing Campaign
---

<p>My third project at Metis used supervised machine learning algorithms to predict if a potential bank client would sign up for a term deposit account using [this UCI dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing); by predicting which clients are more likely to sign-up and focusing efforts on those clients there is the potential to increase campaign success rates. </p>

## Models compared:

1. Logistic regression

2. Bernoulli Naive Bayes

3. Random Forest

4. Balanced Random Forest

5. XGBoost

6. Catboost

##Data exploration and cleaning:
