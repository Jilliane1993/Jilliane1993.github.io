I'm Jillian Etheredge soon to be graduate from Metis's 12 week Data Science Bootcamp. I received my Bachelor's degree in Animal Science from Clemson University December 2019, while entering the job market right before the emergence of a global pandemic was less than ideal it furthered my desire to transition into a more technological focused field. So I spent the next year learning python and about the field of data science to prepare for Metis's Data Science Bootcamp. My time at Metis has introduced me to a variety of applications for different machine learning algorithms and continued to build my desire to learn and grow as a data scientist. I'm currently very interested in natural language processing, computer vision, and applications for machine learning in conjunction with healthcare and wildlife conservation. While these are just a few current areas of particular interest the data science is such a broad and expanding field I'm sure I haven't even begun to scratch the surface of all there is  to explore.

I'm currently looking for employment if you interested in potentially hiring me here are a few links you may find useful:
